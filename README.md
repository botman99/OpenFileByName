**OpenFileByName** caches the list of files in the solution/projects for quicker access.  It handles a large number of files in the solution well (solutions with tens of thousands of files has been tested).

You can open multiple files in the 'Open File By Name' dialog by simply double-clicking on the files you wish to open.
